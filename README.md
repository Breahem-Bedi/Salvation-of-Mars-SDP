# Salvation of Mars
Salvation of Mars is a 2D pixel art puzzle platformer where you are an alien that's been imprisoned on Earth - will you be able 
to get back to Mars?

You start the game by breaking out of your prison cell and out into the main facility. You have no abilities... but as you progress
through the game, you get the ability to speed boost, reverse gravity and create a clone of yourself. At the beginning of each level
you must pick which ability you want to use to solve the level. It's up to you to decide which ability will be best to solve each
puzzle. 

Each level contains a range of puzzles and obstacles, like spikes, slime, moving platforms and buttons that activate or deactivate 
obstacles.
